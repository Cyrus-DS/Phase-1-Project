# Phase-1-Project
This project is hosted by Moringa School as part of the deliverables to enter phase 2 of the Data Science course.
## Business Understanding
The problem statement presented is that of stakeholders who need necessary advice to enable them make a decision on which airplanes to purchase for commercial & private enterprises.
We are to determine which airplanes have the lowest risk for the company in starting the business.
## Data Understanding
The data source is from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.
The data has been filtered to include Aeroplanes, which has had the effect of automatically reducing the data by nearly half.
The data has been cleaned by replacing null values, removing some columns & removing duplicates if any.
For analysis, I have compared the various numerical categories of Total Fatal Injuries, Total Uninjired and the Number of engines in the airplanes. 
## Recommendations
It is recommended that the stakeholders purchase the Boeing Airplane
Boeing seems to have the highest fatal injuries but at the same time the highest number of uninjured persons.
This could be because of its popularity
Boeing Airplane seems to have a lesser amount of engines as compared to airplanes its level, meaning the maintenance costs will be lower.
